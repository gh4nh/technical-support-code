# This script will query the SAS Configuration Server and CAS to check for loggers set to TRACE or DEBUG.
# If any are set it will send an email to the value set in the email variable below.
# The script uses curl's -n to authenticate to CAS to perform that check, so requires a user and password be
# provided in a .netrc file located in the execution user's home directory with 600 permission in the format:
# machine <cas-controller> login <user> password <password>
# It is intended to be run on the Viya server directly as it uses consul.conf, client.token, sas-bootstrap-config and vault-ca.crt in default paths.
# It expects the jq and mail commands to be installed.
